# C++ project template with CMake

As a seasoned software developer, I've had more run-ins with CMake than I can count. But let's be real, it's time to get serious and really learn this thing. Sure, there are a ton of CMake tutorials floating around on the interwebs, but they all focus on small projects. And let's face it, those projects are about as practical as a chocolate teapot. When you dive into larger, real-world projects that use CMake, things get complicated quick. It's like trying to unravel a ball of yarn that's been tangled by a mischievous cat. So, I've taken it upon myself to create a repository that builds a template for a real-world project. Let's cut through the fluff and get down to business!

## Description

TODO: DESCRIBE WHAT FEATURES THIS REPO HAS.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Minimum CMake version is `3.22.0`. Please follow the best answer [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/355565/how-do-i-install-the-latest-version-of-cmake-from-the-command-line) to either install or update the CMake. Download `https://cmake.org/files/v3.22/cmake-3.22.6.tar.gz` if you want to use CMake `3.22`.
* The C++ library [Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) and the C image library [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) are added as git submodules. You don't have to do anything here. Just remember to pass `--recursive` while cloning this repo.
* I use Linux and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my developing environment. So, you probably also need to download the following tools to be able to have a smoother developing experience. `C/C++`, `C/C++ Extension`, `CMake`, `CMake Extension` from VS Code.  `llvm`, `lldb` and `ninja`. ` apt install python3-dev`.

### Installing
* Download repo: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/lionlai1989/cmake_template.git`. If `--recursive` is not used when cloning, then `git submodule update --init` can be run to clone the submodules.
* TODO: ADD INSTALL CMAKE INSTALL COMMAND.

### Build, Install and Execute
```
cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -S . -B build/ && cmake --build build/ -j 4
cmake -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON â€“S . -B build/ && cmake --build build/ -j 4 && cmake --install build/ --prefix /tmp/install-test/
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build/ && cmake --build build/ -j 4 && (cd build/; ctest -V)
cmake -G Ninja -S . -B build/ && cmake --build build/ -j 4 && cmake --install ./build --prefix /tmp/install-test/ && (cd build/; ctest -V)
```
* Run the example command to verify the executable and libraries are rightly created.
`./build/examples/rgb2gray -i ./files/book.png -o ./files/book_gray.png` converts a RGB `image,png` to a grayscale `image_gray.png`.  
`./build/examples/rgb2gray -i ./files/book_in_scene.jpg -o ./files/book_in_scene_gray.jpg` converts a a RGB `image,jpg` to a grayscale `image_gray.jpg`.

### Developing
TODO: Try libvips, CImg, terrasect, and probably opencv. Use Clang Static Analyzer and clang-tidy.
